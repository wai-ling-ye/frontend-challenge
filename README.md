# BusyBus Mobile App

The BusyBus mobile app strives to improve commuters' experience with public buses in cities. The app will allow users to see when their bus will arrive and help them determine how much time they have to get there. This will reduce the frustration of thousands of commuters, especially at busy stops where the bus arrival times may become unpredictable, and the large number of arriving buses may confuse commuters. The app may even help to reduce overcrowding during peak times by helping commuters plan their trip appropriately.

### Problem
- The buses are not always on schedule, and commuters want to know more accurately when their bus is arriving
- Bus stops which serve many bus lines are confusing to commuters because they can't always see which bus is the one that's arriving
- Commuters want to know how much time they have before their bus arrives, and how long it will take for them to get there

### Solution
The BusyBus mobile app solves these problems for commuters by providing real-time bus information on a simple, easy to use app that is accessible from anywhere by using a mobile device. The BusyBus app provides the commuters with the following information on their selected route:
- arrival time of the next bus
- time to arrival of the next two buses
- alternate bus routes and their respective arrival times
